IT and Engineering departments requires an information system that meets its managerial needs, consisting of task scheduling, asset management, parts inventory, cost assessment and reporting functions. This system must be universal and with a high level of coupling with the other systems in use.

## :information_source: About

O departamento de TI e Engenharia precisa de um sistema informatizado para gerenciar todas as suas atividades. Para atender a essa necessidade foi criado o SYS-RID. Este sistema utiliza vÃ¡rias tecnologias, tais como PHP, Python, Script Shell, HTML e MySQL como banco de dados, e roda em um navegador em rede local.

## â˜• Project Proposal

_Main features_

SYS-RID's core competencies revolve around asset maintenance tasks, which can be planned in advance or unscheduled demands. Planned tasks are recorded in documents called Service Order (OS) and can be of five different types: corrective maintenance, preventive maintenance, predictive maintenance, regular inspection or external demand.

_Register of planned tasks_

From an SO, it is possible to know the date and time of issue, identification and description of the asset, type and status of the service, name and contact of the applicant, name and contact of the executor, description and priority of the work. In addition, during the execution of the task, a record of costs, purchases, spare parts and related procedures is maintained. At the end of the task, the total time spent, the personnel resources used, a report of the methods employed and completion of the work, as well as invoices for related expenses are recorded. Only the specialist and the department operator(s) can enter tasks into the schedule.

_Registration of unscheduled demands_

Unscheduled demands can be due to failure of key equipment, aggregated activities or external requests. A history of these works is kept, including identification, nature of the work, proponent, executor, date and time of execution, total time spent and a brief report of the task performed. The department specialist, operator(s) and technician(s) can record the execution of unplanned tasks, as long as they are the executor.

_Inventory_

SYS-RID maintains an inventory where work tools, equipment and spare parts are registered. It is possible to know the quantities in stock of the different

## ðŸ’» Development Status

This project was initially conceived as a prototype for implementation, but unfortunately it was discontinued due to some restrictions. The project has been discontinued and there are no further updates or support for it. However, the repository with the project files is available and can be used for academic research purposes. It is important to highlight that the project is maintained as it is without any warranty or liability on the part of the author. Only the repository content is available for consultation, but the use or implementation is the responsibility of the user.
